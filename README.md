# image-compressor
a basic image compressor/decompressor. please do not use for actual compression. standard algorithms like PNG DEFLATE and JPEG DCT are much better.  
Example:
Original JPEG image (4% compression ratio compared to bitmap): ![alt text](https://github.com/kliu31415/image-compressor/blob/master/a.jpg?raw=true)
Compressed image (51% compression ratio compared to bitmap): ![alt text](https://github.com/kliu31415/image-compressor/blob/master/Capture.PNG?raw=true)  
(Clearly, JPEG is much more efficient)
